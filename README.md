EasyLAT
=======
THe EasyLAT project is currently an investigation into an easy and
maintainable archive setup for language resources with
[CMDI](http://www.clarin.eu/cmdi/) metadata. Its based on [Fedora Commons](http://fedora-commons.org/)
and [Islandora](http://islandora.ca/).

Currently the setup of this project consists of two parts:

* a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) setup to easily get the
  Fedora/Islandora setup EasyLAT requires
* the tools/scripts to enable an import of existing metadata records and
  language resources
